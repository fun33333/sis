# ðŸš¨ MANUAL PACKAGE INSTALLATION GUIDE

## Problem
PowerShell execution policy is blocking npm install

## Solution 1: Change PowerShell Policy (Recommended)

Run PowerShell as Administrator and execute:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

Then run:
```cmd
cd frontend
npm install
```

## Solution 2: Use Command Prompt Instead

1. Open Command Prompt (not PowerShell)
2. Navigate to frontend folder
3. Run: `npm install`

## Solution 3: Manual Package Installation

If npm still fails, manually download packages:

### Download these files:
1. Go to: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apollo/client
2. Download the package
3. Extract to `frontend/node_modules/@apollo/client/`

### Or use yarn instead:
```cmd
cd frontend
yarn add @apollo/client graphql date-fns
```

## Solution 4: Use Node Version Manager

Install nvm-windows and use Node.js 18+:
```cmd
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
cd frontend
npm install
```

## Verification

After installation, check:
- `frontend/node_modules/@apollo/client/` exists
- `frontend/node_modules/graphql/` exists
- `frontend/node_modules/date-fns/` exists

## If All Else Fails

I can create a version without Apollo Client that uses fetch API instead, but GraphQL is much better for this project.
