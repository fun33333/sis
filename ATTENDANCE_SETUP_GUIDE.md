## 📋 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Install Frontend Packages

```cmd
cd frontend
install-packages.bat
```

**Option B - Direct npm install:**
```cmd
cd frontend
npm install
```

**Packages Installed:**
- `@apollo/client` - GraphQL client
- `graphql` - GraphQL core library
- `date-fns` - Date formatting utility

---

### Step 2: Install Backend Packages

```cmd
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**New Packages:**
- `graphene-django>=3.0`
- `django-graphql-jwt`
- `django-graphql-auth`
- `graphene-django-optimizer`

---

### Step 3: Run Database Migrations

**Option A - Using Batch Script:**
```cmd
cd backend
run_migrations.bat
```

**Option B - Manual migration:**
```cmd
cd backend
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

**Migration Changes:**
- Added 10+ new fields to `Attendance` model
- Added 5+ new fields to `StudentAttendance` model
- Added 'leave' status to attendance choices
- Added audit trail fields (created_by, updated_by, etc.)

---

### Step 4: Start Backend Server

```cmd
cd backend
python manage.py runserver
```

Server will start at: `http://localhost:8000`

---

### Step 5: Start Frontend Server

```cmd
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Frontend will start at: `http://localhost:3000`

---

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Test 1: GraphQL Playground

1. Open browser: `http://localhost:8000/graphql/`
2. You should see GraphiQL interface
3. Try this test query:

```graphql
query {
  teacherClasses
}
```

**Expected Result:** JSON array with teacher classes

---

### Test 2: Teacher Login & Attendance

1. Login as Teacher at: `http://localhost:3000/login`
2. Navigate to: `/admin/teachers/attendance`
3. You should see:
   - Class selection dropdown
   - Date picker
   - Student list (if class selected)
   - Attendance marking buttons (Present/Absent/Leave/Late)

---

### Test 3: Mark Attendance

1. Select a class
2. Select today's date
3. Mark students as Present/Absent/Leave
4. Click "Save Attendance"
5. Check for success message

**Expected Result:** "Attendance marked successfully! 🎉"

---

### Test 4: Edit Attendance (Within 7 Days)

1. Go to attendance page
2. Select same class and date from Test 3
3. You should see "Edit Mode" badge
4. Change some student statuses
5. Click "Update Attendance"

**Expected Result:** "Attendance updated successfully!"

---

### Test 5: View Edit History

1. After editing attendance (Test 4)
2. Click "Show History" button
3. You should see:
   - List of edits with timestamps
   - User who made the edit
   - Edit reason (if provided)

---

### Test 6: Attendance Statistics

1. On attendance page
2. Look at stats cards at top
3. You should see:
   - Present count
   - Absent count
   - Leave count
   - Monthly average percentage

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations:
1. ⚠️ npm install might fail due to PowerShell execution policy
   - **Solution**: Use `install-packages.bat` or run as administrator
   
2. ⚠️ GraphQL playground requires authentication
   - **Solution**: Use JWT token from login response
   
3. ⚠️ Student photos might not display if MEDIA_ROOT not configured
   - **Solution**: Check Django MEDIA_ROOT and MEDIA_URL settings

### Future Enhancements:
- 📅 Calendar view for attendance history
- 📊 Advanced analytics and reports
- 📧 Email notifications for low attendance
- 📱 Mobile app for quick marking
- 🔄 Offline mode with sync

---

## 📊 Performance Optimizations

### Implemented:
- ✅ Efficient database queries with select_related
- ✅ Atomic transactions for data integrity
- ✅ Update only changed fields (update_fields parameter)
- ✅ GraphQL query optimization ready

### Recommended:
- 🔄 Add Redis caching for attendance stats
- 🔄 Implement DataLoader for N+1 prevention
- 🔄 Add database indexes on frequently queried fields
- 🔄 Enable query complexity limiting

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Module '@apollo/client' has no exported member"
**Solution:** Packages are in package.json but not installed. Run:
```cmd
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Issue: "Attendance model has no attribute 'update_counts'"
**Solution:** Run migrations to update database schema:
```cmd
cd backend
python manage.py migrate
```

### Issue: "Permission denied" when marking attendance
**Solution:** Ensure:
1. User is logged in as teacher
2. Teacher has assigned_classroom set
3. User is trying to mark attendance for their own class

### Issue: GraphQL errors in console
**Solution:** Check:
1. Backend server is running
2. GraphQL endpoint is accessible at `/graphql/`
3. JWT token is valid and not expired

---

## 📞 Support & Next Steps

### For Testing:
1. Create test teacher account
2. Assign classroom to teacher
3. Add students to that classroom
4. Test attendance marking flow

### For Production:
1. Set up proper authentication
2. Configure HTTPS
3. Add rate limiting to GraphQL endpoint
4. Enable query complexity analysis
5. Set up monitoring and logging
